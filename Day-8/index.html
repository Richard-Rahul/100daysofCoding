    <h1>A Love Story of a Different Kind?</h1>
    <pre class="poem">
        She loves the stars and the moon
        He loves the codes and the loops
        She speaks in metaphors and rhymes
        He speaks in logic and lines
        
        They seem so different, yet they are alike
        They share a passion, a spark, a light
        They complement each other, they balance and blend
        They are not just lovers, they are also friends
        
        She teaches him to dream and explor
        He teaches her to solve and create
        She makes him laugh and feel more
        He makes her think and appreciate
        
        They are a perfect match, a rare find
        They are a love story of a different kind
